# Login and live EUR/USD exchange rate

This is a React project that uses WebSocket to fetch and update the value of EUR/USD from an API.

The login and reset password do not actually call a backend.

The page is fully responsive and an internet connection is needed for it to work properly.

To run the project for the first time: `npm install && npm start`.
